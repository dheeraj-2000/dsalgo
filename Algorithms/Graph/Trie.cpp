/*
BRUTE FORCE:- we can just solve this problem by running 2 for loops but that would take O(N^2) complexity which will be very high for this problems.
EFFICIENT APPROACH:- we use TRIE data stucture  to solve this problem which reduces its time complexity to O(N*Log(max_Element)) .
Now, i come to the Explanation :-
1- In general Problems of TRIE we make TRIE then perform operation But in this problem insertion and checking will go hand in hand .
2- First insert 0 in the Trie.
   Ex:- [1,2,3,4] 
   for 1 there will be only 1 check of 1 XOR 0 = 1  for this case we inserted 1 before, After performing XOR we will insert 1 in TRIE and similary the further ones.
   Now Further we will be Inserting XOR of Subarrays that is 
   1
   After Checking Insert - 1
   1 XOR 2
   After Checking Insert - 1 XOR 2
   1 XOR 2 XOR 3
   After Checking Insert - 1 XOR 2 XOR 3
   1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4
   After Checking Insert - 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4
   
   Now you would be thinking how i have compared all the subarrays :- Let me Explain
   
   let say 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 'a' now while checking this 'a' whether its XOR is greater than K , I have Already Inserted 1 and 1 XOR 2 in the TRIE.
   
   now this 'a' gets compared with all the other subarrays out their and make check for the new generating ones.
   
   ( a XOR 1 ) generate check for ( 2 XOR 3 )
   ( a XOR (1 XOR 2) ) generate check for  ( 3 )
   
   Till now we GOT the point how comarison is being made:
   
3- We have to check that Xor of subarrays is Less than K 
   -For every bit of K and Subarrays Xor value SAY B will be checked;
   -Our Structure of TRIE will contain a left and right Pointer and a left count and a right count.
   -if bit of k =1 and bit of B=1 then To make 0 we have to move Left because 1 XOR 0 is 1 and we have include right count in our answer as 1 XOR 1 =0 so right 
    subtree count will be completely added.
   -if bit of k=1 and bit of B=0 then similarly as above we count left subtree count and move right.
   -if bit of k=0 and bit of B=1 then in this case we just need to decide the direction to move, we will move right as B(1) XOR 1(Right) =0 
   -if bit of k=0 and bit of B=0 then in this case we just need to decide the direction to move, we will move left as B(0) XOR 0(Left) =0 
   
   SO, THESE WERE THE 4 CASES THAT NEED TO FIGURED OUT .
   I HOPE U ALL HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE LOGIC.
   TO UNDERSTAND THIS U HAVE TO KNOW BASICS OF TRIE
   HAPPY CODING
