Given two Arrays A[] and B[] of length N and M respectively. Find the minimum number of insertions and deletions on the array A[], required to make both the arrays identical.
Note: Array B[] is sorted and all its elements are distinct, operations can be performed at any index not necessarily at end.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, M = 3
A[] = {1, 2, 5, 3, 1}
B[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output:
4
Explanation:
We need to delete 2 and replace it with 3.
This costs 2 steps. Further, we will have to
delete the last two elements from A to
obtain an identical array to B. Overall, it
results in 4 steps.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 2, M = 2
A[] = {1, 4}
B[] = {1, 4}
Output :
0
Explanation:
Both the Arrays are already identical.

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minInsAndDel() which takes two integers N and M, and two arrays A of size N and B of size M respectively as input and returns the minimum insertions and deletions required.


Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ A[i], B[i] ≤ 10^5
