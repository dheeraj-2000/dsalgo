### Update: Please read this before moving ahead [Important](https://github.com/dheeraj-2000/dsalgo/issues/43)!

## How to contribute ?
* Have a look at open issues, they contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan to be implemented.
* You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
* Fork the repository.
* Clone the repo. to your local system.
* Add the algorithms/codes that you want to contribute (and properly rename you algorithm/code, also if possible keep in the respective folder)
* Make another Development branch. (Apart from main branch).
* Open the pull request.
* Resolve conflicts ( if any ).
* Wait for the pull request to be approved.

## Code I expect (for everyone):

-   Add relevant comments explaining what the code is all about (if possible write the Time and Space complexities)
-   It should be properly formatted and indented
-   Please use proper naming for variables, do not use i,j,k,x,y,z. The variable name should be self explanatory.
-   Use proper names for your files.
-   **Do all your changes in your forked repository branch and not in master branch untill asked.**
-   **I will reject any pull request which looks like spammy or just to have +1 in the counter, so contribute quality code here!**
-   As per guidlines of Hacktoberfest, I will not merge any **plagrised** code or any type of **fishy** code.

**Feel free to contact, if you face any issue in contributing to Open Source**
